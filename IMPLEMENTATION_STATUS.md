## Architecture Highlights

### Modular Scanner System
The package uses a modular scanner architecture where each scanner type (file, directory, codebase) can be extended with different rule engines. This allows for:
- Easy addition of new scanning rules
- Flexible scanning configurations
- Performance optimization per scan type

### Rule Engine Framework
Each rule engine is independent and can be:
- Enabled/disabled via configuration
- Extended with custom rules
- Configured with different severity levels
- Integrated with AI for enhanced suggestions

### Modern UI with Dark Mode
The interface is built with:
- Livewire for reactive components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Alpine.js for interactive elements
- Full dark/light mode support
- Responsive design for all devices

### AI Integration Ready
The package is prepared for AI integration with:
- OpenAI API client structure
- Context-aware prompt generation
- Safe code suggestion framework
- Preview before apply functionality

## Integration Points

### Laravel Framework Integration
- Service provider properly registers all components
- Artisan commands follow Laravel conventions
- Database migrations use Laravel schema builder
- Route registration follows Laravel patterns

### Third-Party Integration
- **Debugbar**: Ready for integration with custom collector
- **OpenAI**: Structured for AI-powered suggestions
- **Export Formats**: JSON, CSV, and planned PDF support

## Development Quality

### Code Quality
- PSR-4 autoloading structure
- Comprehensive error handling
- Type hints and return types
- Consistent naming conventions
- Proper separation of concerns

### User Experience
- Intuitive navigation and interface
- Real-time feedback and progress indication
