# Chat Container Overflow Fix Applied

## Issue Description
User reported: "chat overflows on the container" - the chat container was overflowing its parent container height.

## Root Cause
The flexbox layout was missing proper height constraints. When flex items overflow their container without `min-height: 0`, they can push beyond their bounds.

## Solution Applied
1. **Added `min-h-0` to flex containers**: This is a critical CSS class for flex layouts that prevents flex items from overflowing.

2. **Fixed layout structure**:
   - Main content wrapper: `flex-1 flex flex-col min-h-0`
   - Chat tab wrapper: `flex-1 flex flex-col min-h-0`  
   - Chat container: `flex-1 overflow-y-auto p-4 space-y-3 min-h-0`

3. **Height constraints**:
   - Main panel: Fixed height of `h-[600px]` (600px)
   - Header: Fixed height with `flex-shrink-0`
   - Context selector: Fixed height with `flex-shrink-0`
   - Chat container: Flexible with proper overflow handling
   - Chat input: Fixed height at bottom

## Files Modified
- `/resources/views/livewire/smart-assistant.blade.php`

## Technical Details
- The `min-h-0` class prevents flex items from having an implicit minimum height
- The `overflow-y-auto` ensures long chat histories scroll properly within bounds
- The fixed 600px height provides a consistent container size
- Proper flex hierarchy ensures components stack correctly without overflow

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Open the AI assistant
2. Send multiple long messages to create a lengthy chat history
3. Verify the chat container scrolls properly without overflowing
4. Confirm the input stays at the bottom and header stays at the top
5. Check that the assistant panel maintains its 600px height constraint

## Expected Behavior
- Chat messages should scroll within the container
- No content should overflow outside the assistant panel
- The layout should remain stable regardless of chat history length
- The panel should maintain proper proportions in all states
