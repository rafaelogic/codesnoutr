# Livewire Service Persistence Fix

## Issue Identified
The problem was that Livewire components don't automatically serialize/preserve service objects between requests. The `$aiService` property was becoming `null` after the component was hydrated, even though the service was being created successfully.

## Root Cause
- Livewire serializes component state between requests
- Service objects (like `AiAssistantService`) cannot be serialized
- The `$aiService` property would become `null` after the first request
- This caused the "aiService is null" error in the logs

## Solution Implemented
1. **Created `getAiService()` method**: On-demand service creation instead of storing it as a property
2. **Updated all methods**: Changed from using `$this->aiService` to using `$this->getAiService()`
3. **Improved error handling**: Better validation and fallbacks when service creation fails
4. **Enhanced logging**: More detailed debugging information

## Methods Updated
- `mount()` - Now uses refreshAiStatus instead of direct service creation
- `getAiService()` - New method for on-demand service creation
- `refreshAiStatus()` - Uses getAiService()
- `testAiConnection()` - Uses getAiService()
- `askAI()` - Uses getAiService()
- `getAIResponse()` - Uses getAiService()
- `loadInitialData()` - Uses getAiService()
- `loadContextualData()` - Uses getAiService()
- `getScanSuggestions()` - Uses getAiService()
- `getContextualTips()` - Uses getAiService()
- `getDebugInfo()` - Uses getAiService()
- `checkAiStatus()` - Uses getAiService()
- `forceAiRefresh()` - Uses getAiService()

## Expected Behavior Now
- AI Service will be created fresh on each method call that needs it
- No more "aiService is null" errors
- Proper error handling when service creation fails
- AI Assistant should work consistently across requests

## Test Steps
1. Try asking "hi" again in the AI Assistant
2. Check logs - should see the service being created and used properly
3. The AI should now respond correctly to questions
