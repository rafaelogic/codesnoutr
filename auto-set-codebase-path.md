# Auto-Set Target Path for Full Codebase Scans

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Updated ScanForm Component Logic
**File**: `src/Livewire/ScanForm.php`

#### Modified `updatedScanType()` method:
- When "codebase" is selected: Automatically sets `$target` to `base_path()`
- When "file" or "directory" is selected: Resets `$target` to empty string for user input

#### Modified `setScanType($type)` method:
- Same logic as `updatedScanType()` for consistency
- Ensures target is set correctly when scan type is changed programmatically

#### Modified `mount()` method:
- Added initialization logic to set target based on initial scan type
- Ensures proper state even if default scan type changes in the future

### 2. Enhanced UI Display
**File**: `resources/views/livewire/scan-form.blade.php`

#### Added Codebase Target Display Section:
- Shows a dedicated section when "Full Codebase" is selected
- Displays the actual path that will be scanned
- Includes a visual confirmation with green checkmark icon
- Uses monospace font for the path display for better readability

## How It Works

### User Experience:
1. **Default State**: Form loads with "Single File" selected, target field is empty
2. **Select "Full Codebase"**: 
   - Target field disappears
   - New section appears showing "Full codebase scan will analyze all files in: [project-path]"
   - Target is automatically set to the current project's base path
3. **Switch Back**: When switching to "Single File" or "Directory", the target field reappears and is reset to empty

### Technical Implementation:
- `base_path()` Laravel helper function is used to get the current project's root directory
- The target is set automatically without user intervention
- Validation logic already handles that target is not required for codebase scans
- UI provides clear feedback about what will be scanned

## Benefits

✅ **Improved UX**: Users don't need to manually enter the project path for full codebase scans
✅ **Accuracy**: Eliminates potential errors from manual path entry
✅ **Clarity**: Users can see exactly what path will be scanned
✅ **Consistency**: Same behavior whether scan type is changed via UI or programmatically

## Example Behavior

When "Full Codebase" is selected, the target display shows:
```
✓ Full codebase scan will analyze all files in:
  /Users/rafaelogic/Desktop/projects/laravel/my-project
```

This makes it clear to users exactly what will be scanned when they choose the full codebase option.
