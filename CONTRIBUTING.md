- Composer
- Laravel 10+ test application
- Git

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rafaelogic/codesnoutr.git
   cd codesnoutr
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Set up test Laravel application**:
   ```bash
   # Create a test Laravel app
   composer create-project laravel/laravel ../test-app
   cd ../test-app
   
   # Require your local package
   composer config repositories.codesnoutr path ../codesnoutr
   composer require rafaelogic/codesnoutr:@dev
   ```

4. **Set up the package**:
   ```bash
   php artisan codesnoutr:install
   ```

## Coding Standards

### PHP Standards

- Follow [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) coding standards
- Use type hints for all method parameters and return types
- Write descriptive variable and method names
- Add PHPDoc blocks for all public methods and properties

### Laravel Conventions

- Follow Laravel naming conventions
- Use Eloquent relationships properly
- Follow Laravel directory structure
- Use Laravel's built-in features when possible

### Code Style

We use PHP CS Fixer for code formatting. Run it before committing:

```bash
composer format
```

### Testing

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Use descriptive test method names

Run tests:
```bash
composer test
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Types

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual classes and methods
2. **Feature Tests**: Test complete features end-to-end
3. **Browser Tests**: Test UI interactions (when applicable)

### Test Structure

```php
<?php

namespace Tests\Feature;

use Tests\TestCase;
use RafaelOgic\CodeSnoutr\ScanManager;

class ScanManagerTest extends TestCase
{
    /** @test */
    public function it_can_scan_a_single_file()
    {
        // Arrange
        $manager = app(ScanManager::class);
        $testFile = __DIR__ . '/fixtures/test-file.php';
        
        // Act
        $result = $manager->scanFile($testFile);
        
        // Assert
        $this->assertInstanceOf(ScanResult::class, $result);
        $this->assertGreaterThan(0, $result->getIssues()->count());
    }
}
```

### Test Fixtures

Create test fixtures in `tests/fixtures/` for consistent testing:

- Sample PHP files with known issues
- Configuration files
- Expected output examples

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- All public methods must have PHPDoc blocks
- Include `@param`, `@return`, and `@throws` tags
- Provide usage examples for complex methods
- Document any side effects or important behavior

### User Documentation

- Update README.md for new features
- Add examples to the documentation
- Update FEATURES.md for feature changes
- Include configuration options

## Database Changes

### Migrations

- Create reversible migrations
- Use descriptive migration names
- Add foreign key constraints where appropriate
- Consider performance implications

### Model Changes

- Update model relationships
- Add appropriate fillable/guarded properties
- Include model factories for testing
- Update PHPDoc blocks for IDE support

## Frontend Development

### Livewire Components

- Follow Livewire naming conventions
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use proper lifecycle hooks
- Include loading states

### CSS/JavaScript

- Follow existing naming conventions
- Ensure dark mode compatibility
- Test responsive design
- Maintain accessibility standards

## Release Process

- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backwards compatible)

### Changelog

Update CHANGELOG.md with:
- New features
- Bug fixes
- Breaking changes

## Security

### Reporting Security Issues

**Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Please email 40rrafael@gmail.com with:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### Security Best Practices

- Validate all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Escape output properly
- Follow OWASP guidelines
- Test for common vulnerabilities

## Performance Considerations

### Guidelines

- Profile code changes for performance impact
- Optimize database queries
- Consider memory usage for large files
- Use caching where appropriate
- Test with large codebases

### Benchmarking

Run performance tests:
```bash
composer benchmark
```

## Contributing to AI Features

### OpenAI Client Implementation

We have a detailed roadmap for AI integration improvements. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for:

- Current implementation status
- Planned phases and features
- Technical debt and known issues
- Success metrics and KPIs
- High-priority contribution areas

**High Priority AI Contributions:**
1. **JSON Parsing** - Fix docblock escaping and namespace backslash issues
2. **Prompt Engineering** - Optimize prompts to reduce token usage
3. **Caching System** - Implement intelligent caching for similar fixes
4. **Error Handling** - Add retry logic and rate limit handling
5. **Testing** - Expand test coverage for AI features

**AI Feature Guidelines:**
- All AI features must include safety checks (validation, backups, preview)
- Test with multiple OpenAI models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo)
- Include cost estimates in PRs that affect token usage
- Document prompt changes with before/after examples
- Add rollback support for any destructive changes

### AI Testing

When contributing AI features:

```bash
# Test with different models
CODESNOUTR_AI_MODEL=gpt-4 composer test
CODESNOUTR_AI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo composer test

# Test cost tracking
php artisan codesnoutr:test-ai-cost

# Validate safety checks
php artisan codesnoutr:test-ai-safety
```
