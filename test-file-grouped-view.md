# File-Grouped View Implementation

## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. Updated ScanResults Livewire Component
- Added new view mode: `file-grouped`
- Added `getFileGroupedIssues()` method that groups issues by file path
- Modified the `render()` method to handle the new view mode
- Updated `selectAllIssues()` method to work with file-grouped view

### 2. Enhanced View Template
- Added "By File" toggle button in view mode selection
- Created comprehensive file-grouped view section with:
  - File header with icon, name, path, and statistics
  - Progress circle showing resolution percentage
  - List of all issues within each file
  - Individual issue details with severity indicators
  - Action buttons for resolving, ignoring, and marking as false positive
  - Bulk selection checkboxes

### 3. Key Features of File-Grouped View
- **File Organization**: Issues are grouped by file path
- **File Statistics**: Shows total issues, resolved count, pending count, and highest severity
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear separation between files and issues within files
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicator for each file
- **Interactive Actions**: Individual and bulk actions for issue management
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on different screen sizes
- **File Type Icons**: Different icons based on file extension (PHP, JS, CSS, etc.)

### 4. How It Works
1. The `getFileGroupedIssues()` method:
   - Fetches all filtered issues from the database
   - Groups them by `file_path`
   - Calculates statistics for each file (total, resolved, severity distribution)
   - Sorts issues within each file by severity and line number
   - Sorts files by highest severity and total issue count

2. The view displays:
   - Each file as a card with header information
   - All issues found in that file listed below
   - Interactive elements for managing issues
   - Proper styling with dark mode support

### 5. Usage
Users can now:
- Switch between "By Issue", "By File", and "Detailed" views
- See all files that have issues at a glance
- Focus on one file at a time to fix all its issues
- Track progress per file
- Use bulk actions across all view modes

This implementation provides a more file-centric approach to code issue management, making it easier to work through issues systematically on a per-file basis.
