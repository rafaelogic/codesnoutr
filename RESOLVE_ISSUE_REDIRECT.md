# Resolve Issue Redirect Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the redirect functionality for `resolveIssue(#id)` clicks to redirect users to the scan results main display.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Livewire Component Updates (ScanResults.php)

Updated the following methods to dispatch redirect events:

- `resolveIssue($issueId)` - Marks issue as resolved and dispatches redirect event
- `markAsIgnored($issueId)` - Marks issue as ignored and dispatches redirect event  
- `markAsFalsePositive($issueId)` - Marks issue as false positive and dispatches redirect event

Each method now includes:
```php
$this->dispatch('redirect-to-scan-results', scanId: $this->scanId);
```

### 2. JavaScript Event Handler (scan-results.blade.php)

Added JavaScript event listener to handle the redirect:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('livewire:init', () => {
    // Listen for redirect to scan results event
    Livewire.on('redirect-to-scan-results', (event) => {
        if (event.scanId) {
            // Small delay to allow the UI to update before redirect
            setTimeout(() => {
                // Redirect to the main scan results page for this scan
                const currentUrl = window.location.href;
                const baseUrl = currentUrl.split('?')[0]; // Remove query parameters
                window.location.href = baseUrl; // Reload the page without filters
            }, 500);
        } else {
            // Fallback: redirect to dashboard if no scan ID
            window.location.href = '{{ route("codesnoutr.dashboard") }}';
        }
    });
});
```

## How It Works

1. **User Action**: User clicks on "Resolve Issue", "Mark as Ignored", or "Mark as False Positive" buttons
2. **Backend Processing**: The corresponding Livewire method is called:
   - Updates the issue status in the database
   - Refreshes the file group data for the affected file
   - Dispatches the original issue event (e.g., 'issue-resolved')
   - **NEW**: Dispatches 'redirect-to-scan-results' event with scan ID
3. **Frontend Response**: JavaScript event listener catches the redirect event:
   - Waits 500ms for UI updates to complete
   - Redirects to the main scan results page (removes any query parameters/filters)
   - Shows the updated scan results without any specific file or issue focus

## Benefits

- **Improved UX**: Users are returned to the main scan results view after resolving issues
- **Clear Navigation**: Removes confusion about where to go after resolving an issue
- **Consistent Behavior**: All issue resolution actions now behave the same way
- **Clean State**: Removes any filters or search parameters to show the overall scan status
- **Visual Feedback**: Brief delay allows users to see the action was successful before redirect

## Files Modified

1. `/src/Livewire/ScanResults.php` - Added redirect dispatch calls to issue resolution methods
2. `/resources/views/livewire/scan-results.blade.php` - Added JavaScript event handler for redirects

## Usage

After clicking any issue resolution action (`resolveIssue`, `markAsIgnored`, `markAsFalsePositive`), users will:

1. See the issue status update immediately
2. After 500ms, be redirected to the main scan results page
3. View the overall scan results without any applied filters
4. See the updated issue counts and file status

The feature is now fully implemented and ready for use.
