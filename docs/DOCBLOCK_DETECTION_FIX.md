# Docblock Detection Bug Fix

**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Issue:** Array detection not catching class-level code that starts with docblocks  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🐛 The Bug

### Problem
The array context detection was checking if code starts with class-level keywords:
```php
$isClassLevelCode = preg_match('/^(public|protected|private|const)\s+/', $trimmedCode);
```

**But AI-generated code often starts with docblocks:**
```php
/**
 * Indicates if the model should be timestamped.
 *
 * @var bool
 */
public $timestamps = true;
```

The regex only looked at the START of the string, saw `/**`, and returned false!

## 🔍 Evidence from Logs

### Issue 52530 (SalePriceData.php):
```
[INFO] 🔍 Array detection check {
    "target_line": 19,
    "code": "/**\n     * Indicates if the model should be timestamped.\n     *\n     * @var bool\n     */\n    public ",
    "is_class_level_code": 0,  // ← FALSE! Should be TRUE
    "line_content": "class SalePriceData extends Model"
}
```

Result: `is_class_level_code=0` → Not blocked → Inserted → **Syntax error!**

```
Parse error: syntax error, unexpected token "public", expecting end of file on line 24
```

---

## ✅ The Fix

### Updated Detection Logic:
```php
// Remove docblock comments to check the actual code
$codeWithoutDocblock = preg_replace('/^\/\*\*.*?\*\//s', '', $trimmedCode);
$codeWithoutDocblock = trim($codeWithoutDocblock);

// Check BOTH the original AND without docblock
$isClassLevelCode = preg_match('/^(public|protected|private|const)\s+/', $trimmedCode) ||
                   preg_match('/^(public|protected|private|const)\s+/', $codeWithoutDocblock);
```

### Now Detects:
1. ✅ `public $property` → Class-level
2. ✅ `protected function method()` → Class-level
3. ✅ `const CONSTANT = 'value'` → Class-level
4. ✅ `/** docblock */ public $property` → Class-level (NEW!)
5. ✅ `/** docblock */ protected function method()` → Class-level (NEW!)

## 📊 Impact

### Before Fix:
```
Fixed: 0/44 issues
Errors: "unexpected token 'public', expecting end of file"
Reason: Docblock-prefixed properties not detected as class-level
```

### After Fix:
- ✅ Docblock-prefixed code correctly identified as class-level
- ✅ Array context detection will now catch these cases
- ✅ Should reduce syntax errors significantly

## 🎯 Expected Results

When testing now, you should see:
```
[INFO] 🔍 Array detection check {
    "code": "/**\n * ...\n */\npublic $timestamps = true;",
    "code_without_docblock": "public $timestamps = true;",
    "is_class_level_code": 1  // ← NOW TRUE!
}
[WARNING] 🚫 DETECTED: Inside array context!
[WARNING] ❌ AI trying to insert class-level code inside array - SKIPPING
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment

- ✅ Fixed in workspace
- ✅ Deployed to vendor
- ✅ Queue worker restarted
- ⏳ Ready for testing

---

## 📝 Testing

Run Fix All again and monitor for:
1. More "SKIPPING" messages (detecting docblock-prefixed code)
2. Fewer "unexpected token 'public'" errors
3. Increased success rate

---

**Status:** Deployed and ready for testing  
**Confidence:** High - This was the missing piece
