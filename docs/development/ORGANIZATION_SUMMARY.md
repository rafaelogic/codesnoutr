# Directory Organization Summary

This document outlines the recent directory structure organization improvements made to the CodeSnoutr package.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backup Organization
- Created `backups/refactoring/` directory
- Moved all `.original` and `.broken` backup files to centralized location
- Keeps project root clean while preserving refactoring history

### 2. Documentation Structure
```
docs/
├── development/           # Development-related documentation
│   ├── ARCHITECTURE.md   # System architecture overview
│   ├── CONFIG_MOVED.md   # Configuration file migration guide
│   └── CONTRIBUTING.md   # Contribution guidelines
└── guides/               # User guides (future)
```

### 3. Configuration Organization
```
config/
├── build/                # Build and frontend configuration
│   ├── tailwind.config.js
│   ├── vite.config.js
│   └── postcss.config.js
├── quality/              # Code quality and testing configuration
│   ├── phpstan.neon
│   ├── pint.json
│   └── phpunit.xml
└── codesnoutr.php       # Package configuration
```

### 4. Service Layer Architecture
- Added comprehensive service contracts in `src/Contracts/`
- Services now implement proper interfaces for better testing and maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns between different service responsibilities

### 5. Modular Rule System
```
src/Scanners/Rules/Blade/
├── AbstractBladeRule.php      # Base rule class
├── BladeRuleEngine.php        # Rule coordinator
├── Security/                  # Security-focused rules
├── Performance/               # Performance-related rules
├── Quality/                   # Code quality rules
├── BestPractices/            # Best practice enforcement
├── Accessibility/            # Accessibility checks
├── SEO/                      # SEO optimization
└── Maintainability/          # Code maintainability
```

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Project Root**: Configuration files organized by purpose
2. **Better Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
3. **Improved Testing**: Proper interfaces enable better mocking
4. **Enhanced Documentation**: Structured docs for different audiences
5. **Modular Architecture**: Easy to extend with new features
6. **Professional Organization**: Follows Laravel and PHP best practices

## Updated Commands

The composer.json scripts have been updated to use the new configuration paths:

```bash
composer test          # Run tests with new phpunit.xml location
composer format        # Format code with new pint.json location
composer analyse       # Analyze code with new phpstan.neon location
composer all-checks    # Run all quality checks
```

## Migration Notes

- All build tools automatically find their configuration files
- Composer scripts updated to reference new paths
- Original functionality preserved with improved organization
- Architecture documentation added for future development

This organization provides a solid foundation for continued development and makes the codebase more professional and maintainable.
