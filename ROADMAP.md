## 🎯 Phase 1: Stability & Reliability (Q4 2025)

**Goal:** Make the current implementation more robust and production-ready for local development.

### 1.1 Enhanced Error Handling
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Effort:** Medium

- [ ] Implement exponential backoff for rate limits
- [ ] Add automatic retry logic (max 3 attempts)
- [ ] Better timeout handling with progressive increases
- [ ] Graceful degradation when API is unavailable
- [ ] User-friendly error messages
- [ ] Circuit breaker pattern for repeated failures

**Implementation Notes:**
```php
// Retry logic with exponential backoff
protected function callOpenAIWithRetry(string $prompt, int $maxTokens = null, int $attempt = 1): ?array
{
    try {
        return $this->callOpenAI($prompt, $maxTokens);
    } catch (RateLimitException $e) {
        if ($attempt >= 3) throw $e;
        
        $delay = pow(2, $attempt) * 1000; // 2s, 4s, 8s
        usleep($delay * 1000);
        
        return $this->callOpenAIWithRetry($prompt, $maxTokens, $attempt + 1);
    }
}
```

### 1.2 Improved JSON Parsing
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Effort:** Medium

- [ ] Better handling of namespace backslashes (\\\\\\\ → \\)
- [ ] Validate JSON structure before parsing
- [ ] Provide helpful error messages for malformed JSON
- [ ] Add JSON schema validation

**Current Issues:**
- AI sometimes wraps JSON in ```json blocks
- Docblocks with \\n instead of actual newlines
- Namespace backslashes being quadrupled

### 1.3 Connection & Configuration Validation
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Effort:** Low

- [ ] Enhanced connection testing with detailed diagnostics

## 📝 Notes & Considerations

### Design Principles
1. **Safety First** - Always backup, validate, and preview
2. **Cost Conscious** - Track and optimize token usage
3. **Local Development Focus** - Not for production deployments
4. **User Control** - Never apply changes without confirmation
5. **Graceful Degradation** - Work without AI when unavailable

### Future Considerations
- **Privacy Concerns** - Code sent to OpenAI servers (document clearly)
- **Enterprise Version** - Self-hosted models for sensitive codebases
- **Compliance** - GDPR, SOC2 considerations for enterprise
- **Offline Mode** - Local model support for air-gapped environments
- **Team Collaboration** - Shared learning across team members

### Open Questions
1. Should we support fine-tuning with project-specific data?
2. What's the right balance between cost and quality?
3. How to handle conflicting style preferences across team members?
4. Should we integrate with CI/CD for automated fixing?
5. How to measure and validate fix quality objectively?
