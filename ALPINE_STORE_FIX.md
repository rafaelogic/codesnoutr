# Alpine.js Store Fix - Dashboard Layout Issues Resolved

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Alpine Store Undefined Error
**Problem**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'dark')`
**Cause**: Alpine.js store was not being initialized properly
**Solution**: Fixed store initialization and naming consistency

### 2. Multiple Alpine.js Instances
**Problem**: "Detected multiple instances of Alpine running"
**Cause**: Loading Alpine.js CDN + Livewire's built-in Alpine.js
**Solution**: Removed CDN Alpine.js, let Livewire handle it

### 3. Nested Layout Issue
**Problem**: Dashboard wrapped in app-layout twice (page + Livewire component)
**Cause**: Livewire component had its own app-layout wrapper
**Solution**: Moved app-layout to page level, cleaned Livewire component

## Changes Made

### `/resources/views/pages/dashboard.blade.php`
```blade
<x-templates.app-layout title="Dashboard" subtitle="Overview of your code analysis activity" pageType="dashboard">
    @livewire('codesnoutr-dashboard')
</x-templates.app-layout>
```

### `/resources/views/livewire/dashboard.blade.php`
- Removed `<x-templates.app-layout>` wrapper
- Cleaned up corrupted template content
- Fixed stat cards layout
- Removed duplicate closing tags

### `/resources/views/components/templates/app-layout.blade.php`
- Removed Alpine.js CDN script (Livewire provides Alpine.js)
- Fixed Alpine.js store initialization
- Enhanced error handling for store initialization
- Proper `theme` store with `dark` property

## Current Structure

### Layout Hierarchy
```
Page (dashboard.blade.php)
└── app-layout template
    └── Livewire component (dashboard content only)
```

### Alpine.js Integration
- Livewire v3 provides Alpine.js automatically
- Store initialized on `alpine:init` event
- Immediate DOM update to prevent theme flash
- Persistent localStorage integration

### Dark Mode Features
- System preference detection
- Toggle button in navigation
- Cross-page persistence
- Immediate theme application

## Testing Results
- ✅ No more Alpine.js store errors
- ✅ Single Alpine.js instance
- ✅ Dark mode toggle works
- ✅ Layout renders correctly
- ✅ Navigation functional
- ✅ Livewire components work

## Browser Console
Should now show clean console without errors:
- No "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors
- No "multiple instances" warnings
- Dark mode toggle responsive
- Proper Tailwind dark classes applied
