# CodeSnoutr Scan Issues - Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified

1. **Fast scan with no results**: The scan was completing too quickly and not showing any results
2. **Column mismatch**: Blade template was looking for `files_scanned` but database column is `total_files`
3. **Data processing issues**: Scan results weren't being processed correctly

## Root Causes Found

### 1. Data Mapping Issues
- **ScanManager**: Looking for `$results['stats']['files_scanned']` but scanners return `$results['summary']['total_files_scanned']`
- **Blade Template**: Using `$scan->files_scanned` but database column is `total_files`
- **Syntax Error**: Duplicate `]);` in processResults method

### 2. Potential SQL Injection Detection Issues
- **Regex Patterns**: Some patterns were too specific and might not catch common vulnerabilities
- **Missing Patterns**: Added more comprehensive patterns for SQL injection detection

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Data Processing in ScanManager
**File**: `src/ScanManager.php`

```php
// Before
'total_files' => $results['stats']['files_scanned'] ?? 0,

// After  
'total_files' => $results['summary']['total_files_scanned'] ?? $results['stats']['files_scanned'] ?? 0,
```

### 2. Fixed Blade Template Column Reference
**File**: `resources/views/livewire/scan-results.blade.php`

```blade
<!-- Before -->
{{ number_format($scan->files_scanned ?? 0) }}

<!-- After -->
{{ number_format($scan->total_files ?? 0) }}
```

### 3. Enhanced SQL Injection Detection
**File**: `src/Scanners/Rules/SecurityRules.php`

Added new patterns to catch:
- SQL with string concatenation: `$sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " . $userInput`
- DB::statement with variables: `DB::statement($sql)`
- More general concatenation patterns

### 4. Created Test File
**File**: `test-vulnerable.php`

Created a test file with intentional vulnerabilities to verify detection:
- SQL injection via string concatenation
- Hardcoded credentials
- Weak MD5 hashing
- XSS vulnerabilities

## Expected Improvements

### Scan Results Should Now Show:
- ✅ Correct file count in scan statistics
- ✅ Proper issue detection for common vulnerabilities
- ✅ Better SQL injection pattern matching
- ✅ Hardcoded credential detection
- ✅ Weak cryptography detection

### Debug Information:
- Files scanned count should be accurate
- Issues should be detected and displayed
- Scan progress should reflect actual processing

## Testing the Fixes

1. **Run a scan** on the test file or full codebase
2. **Check scan results** - should show file counts and detected issues
3. **Verify issue detection** - test file should trigger multiple security warnings
4. **Check scan statistics** - should show accurate file counts

## Files Modified

1. `src/ScanManager.php` - Fixed data processing
2. `resources/views/livewire/scan-results.blade.php` - Fixed column reference
3. `src/Scanners/Rules/SecurityRules.php` - Enhanced detection patterns
4. `test-vulnerable.php` - Added test file with vulnerabilities

The scan should now properly detect issues and display accurate results instead of running too fast with no output.
