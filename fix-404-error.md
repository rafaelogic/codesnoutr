# Fix for /codesnoutr/results/undefined 404 Error

## Issue Identified
The route `/codesnoutr/results/undefined` was returning a 404 error because:

1. The JavaScript event handler was not properly extracting the scan ID from the Livewire event
2. The scan ID was being passed as "undefined" instead of the actual numeric ID
3. Laravel route model binding was failing when trying to find a Scan with ID "undefined"

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated JavaScript Event Handling
**File**: `resources/views/livewire/scan-form.blade.php`

- Enhanced the `scan-completed` event listener to properly extract scan ID from various event data structures
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Added fallback handling for invalid scan IDs
- Improved error handling to prevent redirects to invalid URLs

### 2. Fixed Livewire Event Dispatch
**File**: `src/Livewire/ScanForm.php`

- Changed the event dispatch from array format to named parameters:
  ```php
  // Before
  $this->dispatch('scan-completed', [
      'scanId' => $scan->id,
      // ...
  ]);

  // After
  $this->dispatch('scan-completed', 
      scanId: $scan->id,
      issuesFound: $scan->total_issues ?? 0,
      filesScanned: $scan->total_files ?? 0
  );
  ```

### 3. Enhanced Controller Error Handling
**File**: `src/Http/Controllers/DashboardController.php`

- Updated `scanResults` method to handle invalid scan IDs gracefully
- Added validation for non-numeric and invalid scan IDs
- Added redirect with error message for invalid scan IDs
- Updated return type annotation to support both View and RedirectResponse

## How It Works Now

1. **Scan Completion**: When a scan completes, the Livewire component dispatches a properly formatted event
2. **JavaScript Handling**: The updated JavaScript extracts the scan ID correctly from the event data
3. **Redirect**: The browser redirects to `/codesnoutr/results/{valid-scan-id}`
4. **Controller Validation**: The controller validates the scan ID before processing
5. **Graceful Fallback**: Invalid scan IDs redirect to the general results page with an error message

## Testing the Fix

1. **Start a new scan** from the scan form
2. **Wait for completion** - you should see console logs showing the scan ID
3. **Automatic redirect** should now work to the correct results page
4. **Manual testing** - accessing `/codesnoutr/results/undefined` should now redirect gracefully

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ Valid scan IDs: Redirect to specific scan results page
- ✅ Invalid scan IDs: Redirect to general results page with error message
- ✅ Console logging: Helps debug any future issues
- ✅ No more 404 errors for malformed URLs

## Debug Information

The JavaScript now logs:
- The full event data received
- The extracted scan ID
- The redirect URL being used

This will help identify any remaining issues with event data structure.
