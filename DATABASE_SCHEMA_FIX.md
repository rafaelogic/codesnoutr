# Database Schema Fix Applied

## Issue Found
The AI Service was failing because it was trying to query a `type` column that doesn't exist in the `codesnoutr_issues` table. The actual column name is `category`.

## What was Fixed
1. **AiAssistantService.php** - Fixed column references:
   - `analyzeProjectContext()` method: Changed `type` to `category`
   - `buildFixSuggestionPrompt()` method: Changed `issue->type` to `issue->category`
   - `buildScanSummaryPrompt()` method: Changed `groupBy('type')` to `groupBy('category')`

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Added proper try-catch blocks around database queries
   - Added fallback values when database operations fail
   - Better logging for debugging

## Expected Result
- The "Failed to analyze project context" warnings should disappear
- AI Assistant should now work properly
- No more database column errors in the logs

## Database Schema Reference
The `codesnoutr_issues` table uses:
- `category` (not `type`) for issue categorization ('security', 'performance', 'quality', 'laravel')
- `severity` for issue severity ('critical', 'warning', 'info')
- `rule_name` and `rule_id` for rule identification

## Test Steps
1. Try using the AI Assistant again
2. Check logs - should see no more "Column not found" errors
3. The AI should now respond properly to questions
