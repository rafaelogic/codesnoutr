# AI Response Format Fix

## Issue Identified
The `getAIResponse()` method was expecting a specific array format but the `AiAssistantService::askAI()` method can return different formats:

1. **Parsed JSON array** - when OpenAI returns valid JSON
2. **`['response' => $content]`** - when OpenAI returns plain text
3. **Direct OpenAI format** - with `choices[0]['message']['content']`

## What Was Happening
- User clicked "Performance Tips" quick action
- `getPerformanceTips()` → `askSpecificQuestion()` → `askAI()` → `getAIResponse()`
- `getAIResponse()` expected string but received array
- TypeError: "Return value must be of type string, array returned"

## Fix Applied
Enhanced `getAIResponse()` method to handle all possible response formats:

1. **Array with 'response' key** - `$response['response']`
2. **Array with 'content' key** - `$response['content']`
3. **Direct OpenAI format** - `$response['choices'][0]['message']['content']`
4. **Other arrays** - Convert to formatted JSON string
5. **Already string** - Return as-is
6. **Null/invalid** - Return error message

## Added Debug Logging
Added logging to see exactly what format the AI service returns:
```php
Log::info('AI Response received', ['response_type' => gettype($response), 'response' => $response]);
```

## Expected Behavior Now
- AI Assistant should properly handle all response formats
- Quick action buttons (Performance Tips, Best Practices, etc.) should work
- Chat responses should display correctly as strings
- Better error handling for unexpected response formats

## Test Steps
1. Try clicking "Performance Tips" quick action again
2. Try asking questions directly in the chat
3. Check logs to see the response format being received
4. AI should now respond properly with text instead of arrays
