# CodeSnoutr Livewire Debugging Instructions

## Current Issue
The JavaScript console shows click events are firing, but Livewire methods are not being called on the backend.

## Diagnostic Steps

### 1. Open Browser Developer Tools
- Press F12 or right-click â†’ Inspect
- Go to Console tab
- Refresh the page

### 2. Run These Commands in Console

After the page loads, run each command and share the output:

```javascript
// Check wire:click buttons
checkWireClicks()
```

```javascript
// Test direct Livewire method calls
testLivewireDirect()
```

```javascript
// Check component status
testCodeSnoutr()
```

### 3. Check for JavaScript Errors
- Look for any red error messages in console
- Check Network tab for failed requests
- Look for any 422 or 500 errors

### 4. Test the ðŸ§ª Test Button
- Click the red "ðŸ§ª Test" button in the UI
- Share what appears in console
- Check if Laravel logs show `simpleTest method called`

### 5. Check Livewire Network Requests
- Open Network tab in DevTools
- Click a directory or file
- Look for XHR/Fetch requests to Livewire endpoints
- Share if you see any failed requests

## What We're Looking For

### Expected Console Output:
```
ðŸ”˜ Found X wire:click buttons
Button 0: toggleDirectory(...)
Button 1: selectFile(...)
âœ… Found component: component-id
ðŸ§ª Testing simpleTest method...
```

### Expected Laravel Log Entry:
```
[timestamp] local.INFO: simpleTest method called - Livewire is working!
[timestamp] local.INFO: toggleDirectory called {"directory": "Actions"}
```

## Possible Issues

1. **Livewire scripts not loaded properly**
2. **CSRF token issues**
3. **JavaScript errors blocking execution**
4. **Livewire version compatibility**
5. **Route/middleware conflicts**

Please run the diagnostic commands and share the complete console output!
